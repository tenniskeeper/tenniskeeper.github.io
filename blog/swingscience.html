          <h2 class="section-heading">Apple Watch Sensors</h2>

          <p>Your Apple Watch has built-in hardware sensors (Accelerometer and Gyroscope) that can be used to track your arm movement. The sensors can sense your wrist rotation, orientation and acceleration speed provided you wear the Apple Watch on your hitting hand and set the Watch Orientation to the same hand. TennisKeeper uses the motion data from these sensors to identify and classify a shot.
            
          
          <h2 class="section-heading">How is a swing detected?</h2>
          <p>Your Apple Watch provides motion updates at a 50 hertz cadence. For a swing to be detected and classified, it must meet the minimum swing speed and rotation angles within the second. If you make a swing and you think it was not counted, or counted incorrectly, it is likely your acceleration is too slow, or wrist rotation (i.e. your swing path) is too short within the 50 Hz window. In that case, you can calibrate your swings settings in TennisKeeper and set your own minimum values. See the Swing Calibration article for more information.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">The Metrics of a Swing</h2>
          <p>The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/getting_processed_device-motion_data">Device Motion</a>
             framework fuses the data from your Apple Watch accelerometer and gyroscope to provide four distinct measurements: 
             <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/cmdevicemotion/1616149-useracceleration">user acceleration</a>, 
             <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/cmdevicemotion/1615967-rotationrate">rotation rate</a>,
             <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/cmdevicemotion/1616050-attitude">attitude</a>, and
             <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/cmdevicemotion/1616164-gravity">gravity</a>. 
             TennisKeeper uses these properties to formulate the metrics of a swing.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Speed</h3>
          <p>This measures how fast your hand is swinging using the <i>user acceleration</i> property. Note that this is not your racquet speed.
            However, different users can swing their hand at very different speed.
          </p>
          <a href="#"><img class="img-fluid" src="img/swing_speed.jpg" alt=""></a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">Swing Speed from two different users</span>
          
          <h3>Rotation</h3>
          <p>This measures your wrist rotation using the <i>rotation rate</i> and <i>gravity</i>. 
            Depending on whether you wear the watch on your left (for left-handed player) or right (for right-handed player) wrist, 
            the direction of rotation determines if the swing will be classified as a forehand vs a backhand shot.
          </p>

           <h4>Right-Handed Player</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>A right-handed player forehand is a counter-clockwise rotation. This means the rotation angles is a negative numbers.
              <li>A right-handed player backhand is a clockwise rotation. This means the rotation angles is a positive number.
            </ol>
             
            <a href="#"><img class="img-fluid" src="img/swing_righthanded.jpg" alt=""></a>
            <span class="caption text-muted">Rotation for Right Handed Player</span>
            <br>

            <h4>Left-Handed Player</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>A left-handed player forehand is a clockwise rotation. This means the rotation angles is a positive number.
              <li>A left-handed player backhand is a counter-clockwise rotation. This means the rotation angles is a negative number.
            </ol>
              
            </p>
            <a href="#"><img class="img-fluid" src="img/swing_lefthanded.jpg" alt=""></a>
            <span class="caption text-muted">Rotation for Left Handed Player</span>
            <br>

            <h3 class="section-heading">Impact Time</h3>
            <p>This is the time when you impact the ball. TennisKeeper determines your impact time based on your swing speed. It is the time when your reached the maximum acceleration in your swing.
            <p>
            You can visualize the impact time in TennisKeeper detail swing graph. 
            The point where you reached maximum acceleration is marked with a red line on your swing path. A perfect impact should be somewhere in the middle of your swing (within the one second window) because ideally you start slow, accelerate, and decelerate. If your impact point is late, it might be because of your preparation.
            </p>
            
            <a href="#"><img class="img-fluid" src="img/swing_impacttime.png" alt=""></a>
            <span class="caption text-muted">Impact Time</span>
            <br>

            <h3>Tilt</h3>
            <p>
              This measures the orientation (aka Euler angles) of the Watch using the <i>attitude</i> property. It is used to assist in the classification of
              a swing that may be a serve, an overhead or even a high swinging volley. In TennisKeeper, they are collectively refer to as a <i>Smash</i>. A swing is classifed as a <i>Smash</i> if one of the following criteria is met:
              <ul>
                <li>If the tilt angle is bigger than the default (i.e. 190.79&#176;)</li>
                <li>If there is a rapid hand rising</li>
              </ul>
              
              The easiest way to see if there is a rapid hand rising is to look at TennisKeeper's <i>3D Swing Path</i> and the 
              <i>2D Time Sequence</i> graph view. Both views rendered the <i>Rotation</i> data in a graph so that you can understand 
              your wrist motion.
            </p>  
            <hr>
            <!--
            <p>So check your forehand volleys to see if it is because you made a big tilt, or if you have a rapid hand rising. 

              If your forehand volley is caused by a big tilt, you can change the tilt angle to be much larger so that it won't be caught by this rule. This may or may not have an impact on your serve, assuming your serve is normal with a rapid hand rising, it should not be a problem.

            </p>
          -->
            <h2 class="section-heading">3D Swing Path</h2>
            
            <p>After you contact the ball, your arm should follow through and complete the motion. This 3D view allows you to visualize the circular path. 
            
            <ul>
              <li>A smooth line is a better swing because it indicates that your wrist is steady without a lot of random wrist movement that can
              potentially reduce the speed or consistency of your shot.</li>

              <a href="#"><img class="img-fluid" src="img/swing_smooth.jpg" alt=""></a>
                <span class="caption text-muted">Smooth vs Jagged Swing</span>
              
              <li>The red line indicates when you impact the ball. It is best if the impact (i.e. maximum acceleration) is somewhere in the middle.
              </li>
              <br>

              <li>The green circle indicates your wrist location when you start your swing. 
                <a href="#"><img class="img-fluid" src="img/swing_highlow.jpg" alt=""></a>
                <span class="caption text-muted">Start and End Location of your Swing</span>
            </p>
            
      
            <h2 class="section-heading">2D Time Sequence</h2>
            <p>While the <i>3D Swing Path</i> view can be thought of as artist's rendition to help you understand your swing pattern, the<i>2D Time Sequence</i> view
            renders the same data in a more technical way in the form of a 2D chart.
            </p>
            <p>
            Your Apple Watch is set to provide motion updates at a 50 hertz cadence. This 2D view shows your wrist movement for the swing across this 1 second time window. By observing the positive vs negative values along this 1 second window, you can understand why this particular swing is counted as a backhand or a forehand based on your wrist rotation.
            </p>
            
            <hr>

            <!--
            <h3 class="section-heading">Swing Calibration</h2>
          <p>You can adjust the minimum speed for a swing to be classified as a valid shot. If the value is set too low, movement such as picking up a ball may be incorrectly counted as a shot. If the value is set too high, you may see fewer number of shots because swings that don't make the threshold will not be counted.
          </p>

          <p>You can also adjust the default rotation angle for your forehands and backhands. If you are not seeing enough forehands, you can try setting the forehand rotation angle to a smaller number. Or you can set the backhand rotation angle to a larger number to ensure you are not picking up false positives from random arm movement.
          </p>

          <p>Your Apple Watch cannot determine if a ball hit the ground or not. Therefore, in this context, a forehand volley is simply a swing with a shorter path (i.e. smaller angles) than a normal forehand. A backhand volley is a swing with a shorter path than a normal backhand.
          </p>

          <p>If a shot has a large tilt angle or a rapid sharp rise motion, it is classified as a Serve or a Smash. While your Apple Watch can determine your hand orientation, it does not know where you are on the court when such movement is detected. Therefore these two shot types are combined into the same category.
